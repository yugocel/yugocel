## **🔒 Who Am I?**

I am a developer.  
I am a system administrator.  
I am a maintainer.  
I am a watcher.  
I *am* the system.

But my identity is irrelevant. You don't need to know who I am. What matters is the code. It's always been about the code. If you think you know who I am, you're already behind.
